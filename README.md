# Mira-Customies

A PocketMine-MP plugin that implements support for custom blocks, items and entities (forked). 
`Mira-Customies is a greatly improved fork of Customies, which was removed a few months ago. This is a well-kept copy of the plugin and its API. Fully functional, plus the improvements are in the management of entities, items, and custom blocks, which allows for better handling without visual bugs. In other words, it is stable.`
